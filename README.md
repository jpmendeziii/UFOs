# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis README.md.

## Deliverable 1:
Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria:
To start the update of the enhanced UFO website for the challenge, the index.html file had to be updated by removing the list element that creates the button.  Four more list elements were created: city, state, country, and shape. These will be like the "Enter Date" list element. Each element should have the same "id" as the object properties in the data.js file.  Please see image below.
