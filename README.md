# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

* Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
* Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis README.md.

### Deliverable 1:
Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria
Deliverable Requirements:
Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter you created in this module, you’ll add filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in the following image:
